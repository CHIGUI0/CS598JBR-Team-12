In the given example, the list is [1, 2, 3].\n\nThe function starts by setting the variable `m` to the first element of the list (`l[0]`). Then, it iterates over each element `e` in the list. If `e` is greater than the current maximum `m`, `m` is updated to `e`.\n\nAfter the loop finishes, `m` will be the maximum element in the list.
