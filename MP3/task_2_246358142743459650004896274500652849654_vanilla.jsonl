The function `count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int` is defined, where `string: str` is the input parameter and `-> int` indicates that the function returns an integer.\n\n2. Inside the function, the `set()` function is used to convert the input string into a set. A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements.\n\n3. The `len()` function is then used to count the number of elements in the set, which is the number of distinct characters in the string.\n\n4.

The function `valid_date(date)` takes a string `date` as input.\n\n2. The `try` block attempts to execute the following code:\n\n   - The `date` string is stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n   \n   - The `date` string is split into three parts at the '-' character.\n   \n   - Each of the resulting parts is converted to an integer.\n   \n   - The day, month, and year are checked to ensure they are within valid ranges:\n   \n     - The month must be between 1 and 12.\n     \n     - If the month is 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, or 12, the day must be between 1 and 31.\n     \n     - If the month is 4, 6, 9, or 11, the day must be between 1 and 30.\n     \n     - If the month is 2, the day must be between 1 and 29.\n\n3. If any of the checks fail, the function returns `False`.\n\n4. If all checks pass, the function returns `True`.\n\n5. If any exception occurs during the execution of the `try` block, the `except` block is executed and the function returns `False`.\n\nSo, the code is correct and does not contain any bugs.

If they are the same, it returns `True`, otherwise `False`.\n\nHere is a step by step explanation:\n\n1. The function `reverse_delete(s, c)` takes two parameters: `s` (a string) and `c` (a character).\n\n2. The line `s = ''.join([char for char in s if char not in c])` removes all occurrences of characters in `c` from `s`. It does this by iterating over each character in `s` and checking if it is in `c`. If it is not, it is added to a new string.\n\n3. The line `return (s, s[::-1] != s)` returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the string `s` after all characters in `c` have been removed. The second element of the tuple is a boolean that is `True` if the string `s` is the same when reversed as it is, and `False` otherwise.\n\nSo, if the string `s` is the same when reversed as it is, the function will return `(s, True)`.
